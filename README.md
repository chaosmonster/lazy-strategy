# LazyStrategy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx).

## Basic lazy loading

Run `ng serve --app=basic-lazy-loading` for a dev server showing how default lazy loading is done. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This example just shows how to use lazy loading without any preloading strategies.

## Basic preload all

Run `ng serve --app=basic-preload-all` for a dev server showing how default lazy loading with PreloadAllModules is done. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This example just shows how to use lazy loading with the built-in PreloadAllModules preloading strategy.

## Basic custom strategy

Run `ng serve --app=basic-custom-strategy` for a dev server showing how default lazy loading with a custom preloading strategy is done. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This example just shows how to use lazy loading with a custom preloading strategy that uses the `data` object of a route.


## Markov strategy

Run `ng serve --app=markov-strategy` for a dev server showing how default lazy loading with a markov chain preloading strategy is done. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This example just shows how to use lazy loading with a Markov chains to determine what to load next. Be aware that this is a minimal example and not ready for production.
